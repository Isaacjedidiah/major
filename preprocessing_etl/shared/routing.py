"""Content-aware starting-tier routing.

Decides which tier an element STARTS on from cheap, deterministic content
signals — modality, length, report type — before any model call is made.
Known-hard content (tables, over-long or flagged-dense elements) starts on
Tier 2 directly, skipping the wasted Tier 1 pass. Everything else starts on
Tier 1 and escalates reactively on low confidence, exactly as before.

This is deliberately a pure function over an ``Element`` plus policy: no I/O,
no model call, no hidden state. That keeps it cheap (it runs for every
element), testable, and auditable — each decision returns the tier AND a
human-readable reason that the orchestrator records in the audit trail.
