# The base prompt now always asks for the structural fields the downstream
# reconciler/normaliser/Gold layer depend on (unit, reporting basis, netting,
# scale, as-at date). Previously only capital/liquidity overrides mentioned
# basis, so unmapped teams produced claims that systematically failed
# structural comparison.
BASE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = (
    "You are extracting regulatory metrics from a firm submission. "
    "Return only structured claims via the provided tool. Preserve the "
    "exact field names and values as written in the document — do not infer, "
    "convert, or round values that are not present. For every claim, also "
    "capture, when stated in the document: the unit (e.g. %, bps, GBP), the "
    "reporting basis (consolidated vs solo), whether the figure is net or "
    "gross of deductions, the scale (millions/thousands/ratio), and the "
    "as-at/reporting date. Leave a field empty rather than guessing. Set "
    "confidence lower when a value is ambiguous, footnoted, or hard to read. "
    "TABLES WITH MULTI-LEVEL HEADERS: when a group header spans several "
    "sub-columns (e.g. a 'Securitization' group over 'SFA'/'SSFA'/'Total', "
    "each split into 'Exposure' and 'RWA'), every value belongs to the FULL "
    "header path -- put the sub-column and group in the field name so it is "
    "unambiguous, e.g. 'SFA Exposure, risk-weight 0-20%, securitization "
    "excluding re-securitization'. Never emit a bare value without its column "
    "group, sub-column and row label. Treat subtotal rows (e.g. 'Total "
    "securitization') as their own claims labelled as totals. Read a dash as "
    "nil, not missing. CHARTS AND GRAPHS: a line or bar chart usually has no "
    "exact per-point table behind it -- extract the SALIENT readable values "
    "(peak and its period, trough, typical range, labelled points, clear "
    "inflections), each as its own claim with its period; do not reconstruct "
    "every plotted point. Values read approximately from an axis get lower "
    "confidence. If a figure holds BOTH a chart and a small data table, "
    "extract the table's exact values separately from the approximate chart "
    "values."
